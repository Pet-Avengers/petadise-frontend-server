# Quick note for the backend
- For the match rate report generation after the digital game, the matchine learning analysis is faked.
- The pet information is hard-coded.
- The user information is set to default as Julia.
- The time in the game is not concurrent to the real world, and it is speeded up to generate more operations for product trail.
